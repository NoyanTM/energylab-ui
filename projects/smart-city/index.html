                Today, Astana IT University conducts research in the IT field in
                multidisciplinary areas: smart systems and technologies, digital
                twins, EdTech, FinTech, AgroTech and energy systems One of them is the
                "Smart City" project aimed at development of urban infrastructure,
                which aims to improve the quality of life of citizens by improving the
                transport infrastructure, development of environmental conditions,
                efficient use of energy resources and implementation of predictive
                analytics principles of data for decision-making in the concept of
                Smart City. One of the tasks of the scientific project is to develop a
                biotechnological filter based on a biological agent to clean polluted
                air in Nur-Sultan, as well as to create a favorable environment for
                the surrounding area.

                The main natural component in the biotech filter is moss. Mosses can
                have a huge positive effect on the environment: they absorb fine dust
                particles, actively absorb gas, including CO2 and NO, while releasing
                oxygen. Mosses are characterized by a high sanitary and hygienic
                effect, due to their antibacterial and septic influence on the
                environment. The technology of moss cultivation (irrigation,
                temperature, humidity, nutrition) in a closed system is provided by
                automating processes using IoT technology. The developed air
                purification system has not only an environmental effect, but also a
                social one. The engineering solution has been designed in terms of
                design and convenience for the citizens.

                One more task of the project is analytics of big data, which is
                collected in different information systems of the city on the basis of
                which it is necessary to make direct conclusions what projects of the
                city it is necessary to develop. Where it is necessary to build a
                school, a hospital, a store, a fire station or expand, optimize the
                city's road interchanges, and possibly launch an additional bus route.
                The sharing economy has been expanding in recent decades, especially
                among the under-35 age group. According to a Goldman Sachs study, this
                service is most popular among millennials. One in three (35%)
                millennials worldwide is willing to rent a car for short periods of
                time. Developments in energy system modeling using machine learning
                will help the city identify potential places to reduce losses and
                increase energy efficiency. To optimize the consumption of various
                resources (electricity, water, heat, etc.) it is important not only
                the efforts of the akimat, but also the need for massive involvement
                of residents. The concept of Smart Home is being developed by large
                companies that are not able to integrate new sensors from other
                manufacturers. A prototype resource management system is being
                developed for a residential house, which will integrate different
                devices (leakage sensor, video camera, smart sockets, meters, smart
                locks, etc.) into one system. Monitor and control it via phone.
