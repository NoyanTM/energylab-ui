                This study is important for the applied testing of methods for
                processing big data using machine learning methods coming from an
                industrial facility that generates electricity, heat, and industrial
                steam. Pavlodar CHPP is special in that it is located in the northern
                zone of Kazakhstan, and has two different consumers - an aluminum plant
                and the population. The complexity in the variability of the consumption
                profile requires the use of modern methods of predictive planning of the
                composition of generating equipment for the day, week, year ahead. The
                long service life of the units, the hours worked, requires constant
                adjustment of the repair plan for the year ahead. It is necessary to
                take into account the curve of dynamic demand for heat and electricity
                by forecasting methods depending on the weather, the variability of heat
                and electricity consumption is changed by probabilistic laws based on
                historical data on consumption of the population.

                <h5 class="card-title">Results</h5>
                In the process of working on a scientific project, a quantitative
                analysis of the data from CHPP-1 of Aluminum of Kazakhstan JSC was
                carried out. Various levels of loading of aggregates were analyzed, data
                clustering was carried out. A CHP model has been developed in the GAMS
                environment for optimal medium-term planning of the composition of
                generating equipment for the day ahead. The numerical results of the
                ARIMA and Decision Tree models show that the effectiveness of the
                proposed approach is manifested with a large uncertainty in demand, when
                the operating costs of the system and fuel consumption increase due to
                unplanned changes in generation. The advantages of the proposed model
                lie in the modeling of uncertainties in solving the stochastic long-term
                problem of choosing the composition of generating units. The developed
                algorithms can be used for other similar CHPPs.

                Today, Astana IT University conducts research in the IT field in
                multidisciplinary areas: smart systems and technologies, digital
                twins, EdTech, FinTech, AgroTech and energy systems One of them is the
                "Smart City" project aimed at development of urban infrastructure,
                which aims to improve the quality of life of citizens by improving the
                transport infrastructure, development of environmental conditions,
                efficient use of energy resources and implementation of predictive
                analytics principles of data for decision-making in the concept of
                Smart City. One of the tasks of the scientific project is to develop a
                biotechnological filter based on a biological agent to clean polluted
                air in Nur-Sultan, as well as to create a favorable environment for
                the surrounding area.

                The main natural component in the biotech filter is moss. Mosses can
                have a huge positive effect on the environment: they absorb fine dust
                particles, actively absorb gas, including CO2 and NO, while releasing
                oxygen. Mosses are characterized by a high sanitary and hygienic
                effect, due to their antibacterial and septic influence on the
                environment. The technology of moss cultivation (irrigation,
                temperature, humidity, nutrition) in a closed system is provided by
                automating processes using IoT technology. The developed air
                purification system has not only an environmental effect, but also a
                social one. The engineering solution has been designed in terms of
                design and convenience for the citizens.

                One more task of the project is analytics of big data, which is
                collected in different information systems of the city on the basis of
                which it is necessary to make direct conclusions what projects of the
                city it is necessary to develop. Where it is necessary to build a
                school, a hospital, a store, a fire station or expand, optimize the
                city's road interchanges, and possibly launch an additional bus route.
                The sharing economy has been expanding in recent decades, especially
                among the under-35 age group. According to a Goldman Sachs study, this
                service is most popular among millennials. One in three (35%)
                millennials worldwide is willing to rent a car for short periods of
                time. Developments in energy system modeling using machine learning
                will help the city identify potential places to reduce losses and
                increase energy efficiency. To optimize the consumption of various
                resources (electricity, water, heat, etc.) it is important not only
                the efforts of the akimat, but also the need for massive involvement
                of residents. The concept of Smart Home is being developed by large
                companies that are not able to integrate new sensors from other
                manufacturers. A prototype resource management system is being
                developed for a residential house, which will integrate different
                devices (leakage sensor, video camera, smart sockets, meters, smart
                locks, etc.) into one system. Monitor and control it via phone.
